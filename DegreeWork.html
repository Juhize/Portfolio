								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/HKI1.png" alt="" /></span><p>The assignment tasked me with planning, building, testing, and documenting an IT infrastructure for a fictional company. I created a marketing company with 11 employees operating from two offices. For servers, I utilized one Windows Server 2016 with a graphical user interface (GUI) and another without GUI. Workstations were equipped with Windows 10 Enterprise, which I configured using VMware virtualization. To streamline workstation installation, I developed a custom image and employed WDS (PXE-boot) for deployment.</p>
								<p> This project served as a substitute for my final internship. The Original document has 144 pages, and it also includes more stuff about cybersecurity. In original document I also explain some key concepts about networking and cybersecurity in my own words. During this work I had some network related issues that turned to be some glitch on VMWare. I tried about every trick in the book (and internet) before reinstalling VMWare. Got 5/5 grade from this work, mainly because I handled so many issues during this work and had to learn new.</p>

							<h3>Active Directory</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Group.png" alt="" /></span>I made templates to make users and used ACL-groups and groups for managing user rights and access. I also delegated some admin rights for ICT and made two global admin users. I've heard that computers are usually in different place on AD, but I found that this way is simpler for managing group policies.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/AD.png"></span>
							<h3>Group policies</h3>							
							<p><span class="image right">
									<img src="images/GP.png"></span>I utilized group policies to implement drive mappings and restrict certain user rights. Additionally, I configured policies to prevent users from viewing the last logged-in user on the login screen, along with making auditing policy changes on the Default policy. Initially, I attempted to configure the core server firewall and services through GPO, but encountered limitations as these settings need to be established before the server can accept such commands.</p>
							
							<h3>Windows "core" server</h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/sconfig.png" alt="" /></span>
								I initially expected this task to be straightforward since I could manage the server through management tools. However, I had to learn about configuring firewall settings and services using Power Shell first. On this server I used Diskpart for partitioning disks and smb-share on folders (which came obsolete when I managed to get server managing tools working). I also did some management using sconfig.</p>
